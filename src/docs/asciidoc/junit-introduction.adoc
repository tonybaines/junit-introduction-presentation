== Some Definitions
[%step]
* **Test Automation**
** Writing and running repeatable verifications
** of the behaviour of an individual piece of code
** ..., or an entire system
** using tools such as JUnit or Selenium
* **TDD**
** A method of incrementally designing and implementing features
in a software system
** by alternately
*** specifying expected behaviour in automated tests
*** writing production code to meet the specification
** and periodically improving the design through refactoring
*** changing the implementation without changing the behaviour


== The value of test automation

The value that a team gets from automated testing **must** be greater
than the effort that they expend creating and maintaining those tests.

[%step]
* Benefits include
** Regression testing
** Fast feedback on changes
** 'Documentation' on the behaviour of the system
* A valuable test
** Is __fast__
** Fails for one reason (specific)
** Expresses the scenario and intent of the test

== Automated Unit Testing
Fine-grained control over the unit under test, useful for covering all significant code paths

[%step]
* Solitary
** One class or method under test
* Sociable
** Any other test within the component boundary

== Automated Integration Testing
Used for checking assumptions about how other components' interfaces and how they behave

[%step]
* *Real* External Component
** e.g. Database - schema and SQL
** e.g. RESTful service - URIs and payloads

== Automated Functional Testing

[%step]
* End to end scenarios
* Focus on the happy-path
** Rely on more detailed tests

== Anatomy of an Automated Test

[%step]
* **Arrange**
** Set-up the system / module under test
** e.g. set configuration parameters, populate DB tables
* **Act**
** Invoke some action(s) on the system / module
** e.g. login and submit a form with valid values
* **Assert**
** Verify the expected state
** e.g. at the correct page, values in the DB as expected

== State-based Testing

Assertions based on _values_

[%step]
1. Do something which changes the state of the system
2. Verify the new state

[source, language="java"]
----
assertThat(bankAccount.balance(), is(Money.NaN));
----

== Behaviour-based Testing

Assertions based on _interactions_
[%step]
1. Send a signal
2. Verify the interactions



== Assertions
* Role
* Hamcrest

== Maintaining Tests

* TBA
